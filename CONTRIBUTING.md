# Contributing to Infrastructure as Code Templates

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## 🎯 Project Goals

This repository aims to provide **practical, production-ready examples** of system design patterns implemented with Infrastructure as Code. Each contribution should:

1. **Represent a real-world system design pattern**
2. **Be production-ready** with security and scalability in mind
3. **Include comprehensive documentation**
4. **Follow best practices** for the chosen technology stack
5. **Be easily understandable** and well-documented

## 📋 Contribution Guidelines

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** - Avoid duplicating work
2. **Discuss your idea** - Open an issue to discuss your system design
3. **Review existing templates** - Understand the current structure and patterns

### Template Structure

Each system design template should follow this structure:

```
terraform/
└── [system-design-name]/
    ├── README.md                 # Comprehensive documentation
    ├── main.tf                   # Main configuration
    ├── variables.tf              # Input variables
    ├── outputs.tf                # Output values
    ├── versions.tf               # Terraform and provider versions
    ├── providers.tf              # Provider configuration
    ├── [component].tf            # Individual components
    ├── examples/                 # Usage examples
    │   ├── basic/
    │   └── advanced/
    └── tests/                    # Infrastructure tests
```

### Documentation Requirements

Every template must include:

1. **README.md** with:
   - System design overview and architecture diagram
   - Use cases and scenarios
   - Prerequisites and requirements
   - Step-by-step usage instructions
   - Cost considerations
   - Security considerations
   - Monitoring and logging setup
   - Troubleshooting guide

2. **Architecture Diagram** - Visual representation of the system
3. **Examples** - Basic and advanced usage examples
4. **Testing Instructions** - How to validate the implementation

### Code Standards

- **Terraform Best Practices**:
  - Use consistent naming conventions
  - Implement proper variable validation
  - Include comprehensive outputs
  - Use data sources where appropriate
  - Follow the official Terraform style guide

- **Security Best Practices**:
  - Implement least privilege access
  - Use encryption at rest and in transit
  - Follow security group and IAM best practices
  - Include security considerations in documentation

- **Cost Optimization**:
  - Use appropriate instance types
  - Implement auto-scaling where applicable
  - Include cost estimation in documentation
  - Use spot instances where possible
