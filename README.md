# Infrastructure as Code Templates

A comprehensive collection of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates and system design implementations ready to use in production environments.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This repository was born from the need to provide **practical examples of system design patterns** and their **Infrastructure as Code implementations**. It serves as a starting point for developers, DevOps engineers, and architects who need to implement specific infrastructure patterns but don't know where to begin.

### Why This Repository?

- **System Design Focus**: Each template represents a real-world system design pattern
- **Production Ready**: Templates are designed with best practices, security, and scalability in mind
- **Learning Resource**: Perfect for understanding how to translate system design concepts into actual infrastructure code
- **Quick Start**: Jump-start your infrastructure projects with proven patterns
- **Community Driven**: Accepts contributions and improvements through pull requests

## 🏗️ Available System Designs

### 🌐 Static Sites with Global CDN
**Location**: `terraform/static_sites/`

## 📚 System Design Patterns Covered

This repository aims to cover various system design patterns including:

### ✅ Implemented

- [x] **Static Site Hosting** - Global CDN with disaster recovery


### 🔄 In Progress

- [ ] **Microservices Architecture** - Containerized services with load balancing
- [ ] **Event-Driven Architecture** - Message queues and event processing

## 🎨 Design Principles

Each template follows these core principles:

1. **Modularity**: Reusable components that can be combined
2. **Security First**: Built-in security best practices
3. **Scalability**: Designed to handle growth
4. **Cost Optimization**: Efficient resource utilization
5. **Monitoring**: Built-in observability
6. **Documentation**: Comprehensive READMEs and examples
7. **Testing**: Infrastructure testing patterns
8. **Compliance**: Industry standard compliance patterns

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions! This project thrives on community input and improvements.

### How to Contribute
